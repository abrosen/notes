\section{Distributed DHT Computing}




Our goal is to further develop ChordReduce and release a complete verion: a DHT based platform for solving embarrassingly parallel problems using DHTs.
The steps involved in this are listed below.

\begin{itemize}
	\item We must create a highly configurable and easy to use DHT framework based off the DHT abstractions we have discovered.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item This will be done in Python3 jointly with Brendan.
		\item We will be using test driven design.
		\item The goal of this step is \textbf{not} to create a DHT, but to create an easily extensible abstract framework anyone to make DHTs.
		\item The abstraction comes from implementing the relationship we found between DHT spheres of responsibility and Voronoi tessellations
	\end{itemize}
	\item We will use the above framework to implement a few of the more popular DHTs.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item This will serve as both examples for home to implement our framework as well and the building blocks for the next step.
	\end{itemize}
	\item Implement MapReduce on these DHTs and compare their performances.
	\item Create a  processor scoring mechanism for creating virtual nodes.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item This score is a relative score, since the amount of work a node can carry is determined by the amount other nodes can carry.
		
		\item This ties in directly to the autonomous load balancing.
	\end{itemize}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The emphasis is our framework is optimized for robustness over everything else.
	\end{itemize}
	
\end{itemize}
