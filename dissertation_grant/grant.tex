\section{What are DHTs}
My dissertation focusing on creating a generalized framework for distributed computing based on Distributed Hash Tables (DHTs).
Distributed Hash Tables are a tool which allows a computers (nodes) to self-organize into a decentralized network for storing and retrieving data.

There are many different types of DHTs, but all DHTs share very important qualities.
They are \textit{scalable}, which means that each additional node in the network minimally impacts the cost of keeping the network organized.
DHTs are also highly \textit{fault-tolerant}.
Unlike many other systems, DHTs assume that nodes will be continuously entering and leaving the network.
Because of the way DHTs are organized, DHTs can handle large scale failures, such as power outage affecting an entire city.
The last quality of DHTs is that they are  \textit{load-balancing}. 
This mean the data the is stored in a DHTs is evenly distributed among nodes in the network.


\section{What Have We done so far and why should the reader care}

All of these qualities are highly desirable in a distributed computing, so it was a natural step for us to build distributed computing framework based on DHTs.
We have shown in previous work that DHTs can be used to distribute work among nodes the same way data is distributed \cite{chordreduce}.


\section{What do we plan on doing}


\subsection{Why is this exciting }
Some example problems are Monte-Carlo Methods (of interest to mathematicians and economists), 
Our framework would not only be of interest to computer scientists.
The ``plug-and-play'' nature we envision would make it easy for experts in other fields to use our framework to solve computationally intensive problems.


\section{What do I need funding for?}

Heterogeneous networks

We have successfully developed our software to achieve this, but need funding to do real world network tests. 
These tests would allow us to experimentally show that our software conclusively works on a large scale and on heterogeneous networks.



I need hardware of different types and locations.



This project would help by enabling allowing  both organizations with large amounts of computing power and average developers with a fewer resources spend less time setting up and configuring their hardware to work together;  the goal is for our software to make distributed computing more of matter of ``plug-and-play.''

\section{Budget and Justification}
\centering{
\begin{tabular}{|c|r|}
	
	\hline Item & Amount requested \\
	\hline Cloud Computing Server Time & \$1200 \\ 
	\hline 10x Raspberry PI 2 & \$400\\
	\hline Raspberry PI peripherals & \$250\\

}

The base cost for a cloud computing machine ranges between \$0.008 and \$0.075 per machine per hour.
We need at least 100 machines for at least 100 hours of experimentation at the bare minimum.
Buying cloud computing time from both Google and Amazon would allow us to do realistic networks

However, we still need more machines in order to test heterogeneity in the network.
Raspberry PIs allow us to test the lower end of computing power.
Raspberry PIs are credit-card sized computers which are powerful enough to test our software, but much weaker in computational power compared to what we can purchase from Amazon.
They would allow us to our autonomous load-balancing and see how well our algorithms distribute work between stronger and weaker nodes.
Furthermore, we could attach some to different network interfaces, making some wired and some wireless, which would allow us to further vary our network topology.
%
%Recruiting volunteers would add greater amounts of realism to our experiment.
%Pending IRB approval, we would use these funds to advertise on online technical sites and ask users to run our program.
%No information would be gathered from the users other than their IP address and a relative measure of their computational power
