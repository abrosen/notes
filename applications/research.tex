% DO NOT USE THE WORD TOOL
% Empahsize that my research is applicable to big data problems and research
% Talk about collaberation + inter-disciplinary


I find great value in abstracting techniques and platforms even further, as that makes it possible to see novel applications for various technologies.  
This can be seen in my work on Distributed Hash Tables, where I showed that DHTs can be mapped to Voronoi Tessellations and Delaunay Triangulation.


A large part of why I do research is that I want to help people.
When I started doing undergraduate research, I worked in the Sonification Lab at Georgia Tech.
There, I helped PhD students implement their research in creating  non-traditional user-interfaces geared towards the visually impaired community.
