\begin{abstract}
	Recording your lectures may seem overwhelming, but in reality is actually quite easy to do.  
	This paper serves as a guide to do so.
	We explore the benefits to students and instructors for recording lectures, such as review material, mitigating illnesses and outbreaks, and future use for flipped classrooms. 
	We discuss the software options available to record lectures and weigh the benefits and consequences of various hosting options.

\section{Introduction}


This paper advocates that every CS teacher record their lectures.
Recording your lectures has many benefits for the students, some benefits for you \cite{Nobody06}

This paper is intended for an audience of teachers, primarily people who teach using a laptop.




\begin{itemize}
	\item In Section \ref{why}, we discuss the motivations for this paper and impacts  on students for recording your lecture.
\end{itemize}
\section{Motivation}

Recording lectures has been

recording all of a professor's lecture in high fidelity is something that has become possible only in recent years.
Modern laptops come with at least 1080p screens and powerful processors able to handle both recording 

The emergence of codecs such as AV1 (not to be confused with .avi files) means that even as storage becomes more cheaper and plentiful, high quality files are getting smaller and smaller \cite{AV1comp}, with less restrictive licenses. 
Consumer cameras get better every year and can record in UHD (2160p resolutions or greater).


\subsection{Student Reference and study aid}


Ease of review
eases Note taking pressure


One study \cite{shimoff2001effects}  on an introductary Psychology course found that quiz grades increased by about a letter grade with the lectures recorded compared to the same course without recordings.

\subsection{Regular Illnesses and Outbreaks}
Our students are coming under more and more pressure to succeed.  
Enrollments in computer science are up across all universities, which means more students in a class. 
These increases in students and a drop in vaccincation rates accross the US have lead to outbreaks at numerous universities such as X at ABC, and a Mumps outbreak at Temple University.

Sometimes, the only 

These outbreaks are in addition to regular infections, like influenza. 

Students often come to class sick CITE, thus infecting other students.

\subsection{Use by instructor}
Illness of instructor, 
Experiment with flipped class room.


\subsection{Effects on Attendance}
One concern instructors may have about recording lectures is that it may create an incentive for students to skip class \cite{larkin2010but}.




Recording lectures has been found to have no negative effects on attendance (cite for this) \cite{shimoff2001effects}, if not increased effects on attendance \cite{shimoff2001effects}

\subsubsection{Ensuring Attendance}
If for some reason, students do stop attending or you want to ensure students will keep attending, there are a few suggested steps you can take \cite{larkin2010but}:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Create more active learning exercises.
\end{itemize}

Regardless, we suggest that for your first time recording, a simple approach that requires less work will yield best results.  
After that, make incremental changes throughout the semester.

\footnote{Also, ensuring that the course is not held at 8am or some other early hour will be more likely to ensure attendance.}

\subsection{Perceived Barriers to Adoption}
I'm scared of being on camera because I mess up.

This looks like too much work!

Accessibility concerns (see above about too much work, but just ask your drs.  These are supplemental resourses, they are not required.  Speak with your students).

Legal concerns (punt, ask your chair, or host on drive.)

\section{Enterprise Options}
I've listed this first because this is probably the most straightforward option.
Your institution may be paying for this already.

Your university, college, or department might already have a license or contract with an enterprise solution.
Companies such has Panopto  offer a "one stop shop" hosting your data AND recording.


\subsection{Cons}
Your students will need to access

\section{Open Source Recording}
The current best open source option for both recording and streaming (transmitting video live) is OBS Studio. (cite image)

OBS Studio is an extremely configurable, cross-platform recording program that is currently used by many streamers and has popular usage on Twitch, a video game streaming platform that brings in over one million viewers daily.  (image of hbomberguy or eu4 on twitch, example live stream )

It also has a number of filters built in, including a  ``Chroma Key'' filter, which can be used to remove a green screen if one is used (more on this later).



\section{Required Hardware and Equipment}
A modern laptop is all that is required.

Additional equipment costs up to around \$200, with tax, depending on the needs.

\subsubsection{Example laptops}
\subsubsection{Specs}






\subsection{Additional Equipment}

For example, I used have used a good quality microphone (\$100), a 1080p 60fps webcam (\$70), and a foldable greenscreen (\$40), to produce high qulality video recordings at home


\subsection{Concerns}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Your hardware must be good. Using an industrial strength IDE such as IntelliJ or Eclipse and any recording software can be taxing to older laptops.
	There are a few  ways to mitigate this  if getting a better laptop is problematic. 
	First is to have the IDE open before recording.
	Alternatively, migrate away from Intellij, Eclipse, and the like and use a more lightweight editor, such as Sublime Text, Atom, Visual Studio Code, Geany, or the old classics of Vim and Emacs.
	Another fix is to change the recording encoding setting to perform less encoding during recording; the result of this is that the file sizes will be higher, but it will be less taxing on the CPU.
	
	High end laptops (\$1000+ laptops with GTX 1050 graphics cards or better) can make use of hardware encoding, such as NVENC, which uses the graphics card to do the heavy lifting of the recording, which frees up a lot of processing power for the computer (INSERT PIC HERE).
	
	
	If you are just recording powerpoint slides or capturing the board with the webcamera, you should run into no difficulties.
	
	I also highly recommend having your laptop plugged in  so that you get maximum performance.
	\item Student questions can't be heard by your mic.  This is both a good thing, as it will alleviate privacy concerns of students, but students  reviewing the recording will be missing some information.  Thus, get into the habit of repeating and summarizing student queries when recording.  This will also help in large lectures, where the students present in the lecture won't necessarily hear the question either.
	
\end{itemize}

\section{Editing}

\section{Hosting}

In this section, we explore and look at the benefits of different solutions to host your videos.  
This sections assumes that you are not using an enterprise option, such as Panopto, as that typically provides a hosting solution with it.

\subsection{YouTube}
One of the most well known websites in the world, YouTube is nearly synonymous with video hosting and streaming.


\subsubsection{Positive Considerations}
Google is now in charge of making sure your stuff is accessible.
Videos are stored in Google datacenters\footnote{As we're not privy to the internal organization of datacenters within Alphabet, we'll just be referring to anything owned by Alphabet as owned by Google} and are cached at servers in numerous ISP, which means that your videos are very unlikely to be unaccessible by students.

In addition, easy to access from every platform.

One benefit unique to hosting videos on YouTube is the automatic subtitle files \cite{liao2013large}
Auto generated subtitle files


\subsubsection{Negative Considerations and Mitigation}
YouTube doesn't go down very often.  
But it does sometimes \cite{outage2018} (June 2: 3:30 Outage) \cite{outage2019}, and when it does, student will probably complain to you 

YouTube comments are their own special hell.
Personally, we use comments as part of a ``bug bounty'' for our students.
If we make some error during in our videos, students can leave a comment describing the error for a point of extra credit.

Reuploading

Additional steps need to be taken to allow students to obtain an offline copy of videos.

Legal ramifications of double dipping

Videos getting flagged.

Trolls.  God help you if you bring up feminism in video games or similar topics in an ethics course you decide to post on YouTube.  Expect harassment, up to and including death threats. %thing that ant specie con

\subsection{Vimeo}
Vimeo is a competitor of Youtube, located in New York City.
While they provide the same basic service to the viewer as youtube, Vimeo has a number of significant differences that are worth considering.

\subsubsection{Positive Considerations}
Professional looking
Customization embedding
No Ads
Can make videos easy to download

\subsubsection{Negative Considerations}
The biggest difference betweeen 



Pay for hosting

Also goes down occasionally.

\subsection{Drive or Static Webpage}

Easy offline copies

No legal ramifications if using the school service

\subsubsection{Negative Considerations}
Not the prettiest

Harder to embed videos on canvas or the like.

You may have to pay for hosting




\subsection{Fine, I'll do it myself}

One final option some readers might consider is to host the recordings on their own video server.

\subsubsection{Pros}
The pros of this solution.
\subsubsection{Cons}

Really?  Where are you going to find the time?
Home server? You probably won't have the bandwidth
Server at school?  IT deptartment is going to LOVE you.

\section{Recap}



\section{A Note on Licenses}

State laws on recording (one party consent vs two party consent)

Your school may not like dicovering that the content of their classes is now available online.
