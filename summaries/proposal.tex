\begin{abstract}
Distributed Hash Tables (DHTs) are protocols and frameworks used by peer-to-peer (P2P) systems.
They are used as the organizational backbone for many P2P file-sharing systems due to their scalability, fault-tolerance, and load-balancing properties.
These same properties are highly desirable in a distributed computing environment, especially one that wants to use heterogeneous components.
DHTs can be used not only as the framework to build a P2P file-sharing service, but a P2P distributed computing platform.

Our framework is a completely decentralized framework for organizing heterogeneous units for distributed computation.
It incorporates a load-balancing algorithm that is capable of injecting additional nodes during runtime to speed up existing jobs.
This algorithm also provides a means of redistributing the load among existing workers during runtime.

%applications
Unlike Hadoop and similar MapReduce frameworks, our framework can be used both in both the context of a datacenter or as part of a P2P computing platform.  
This opens up new possibilities for building platforms to distributed computing problems.
By utilizing the load-balancing algorithm, a datacenter could easily leverage additional P2P resources at runtime on an as-needed basis.
Our framework also allows MapReduce-like or distributed machine learning platforms to be easily deployed in a greater variety of contexts.
