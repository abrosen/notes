\section{Preface}
This document serves as a overview of my accomplishments thus far at Temple University.  
I came to Temple in the Fall of 2016.
I was hired as an Assistant Professor of Instruction because of my record of teaching excellence and remarkable amount of experience, having taught numerous courses solo as a PhD student.
Despite the relatively short time-frame between my hiring and now, I believe I have proven myself to be an exceptional teacher.

I teach the CIS 1051 and CIS 1068, which serve as introductions to computer science.
I also teach CIS 2168,  which serves as prerequisite to almost all upper level classes in computer science and is one of the courses large tech companies look at when evaluating and interviewing students (interview problems often draw from this class).  I also have served as the course coordinator for CIS 2168 since the fall of 2018, writing the common final and coordinating the material to be taught between sections.


What distinguishes me as a Professor is dedication constant improvement and making as great of an experience for my students as possible.


I meet with my students whenever they need help; I've met with numerous students late at night via video meetings


I am awesome because
\begin{itemize}
	\item I came in with a relatively huge amount of experience.  Fully focused on teaching
	\item Student frickin love me
	\item My SFFs say so
	\item JAPAN

	\item Online mentoring
