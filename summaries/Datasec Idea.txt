1. Idea
Most network security models assume an nigh-omnipotent/omnicient 

2.  Why is this a big deal?
Interestingly enough this strategy involves the steps we'd want to do to perform automagic load balancing.
This paper would present a new tool that helps in general, not just attackers:  Given region (x,y), inject node into this region.
We already have another tool, IRM, which lets us find hotspots!  

The question I hope to answer with future work is given these two things... can I do automatic load balancing
