\section{Ara}
Ara is short for Ant-Colony-Based Routing Algorithm; this paper is an application of ant communication applied on-demand ad-hoc routing in Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks (MANETs)
Ant colony algorithms are a type of swarm intelligence where simple workers following simple rules produce complex behaviors.  A key feature is that
