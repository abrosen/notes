	title = {Performance comparison of AV1, JEM, VP9, and HEVC encoders},
	volume = {10396},
	abstract = {This work presents a performance evaluation of the current status of two distinct lines of development in future video coding technology: the so-called AV1 video codec of the industry-driven Alliance for Open Media (AOM) and the Joint Exploration Test Model (JEM), as developed and studied by the Joint Video Exploration Team (JVET) on Future Video Coding of ITU-T VCEG and ISO/IEC MPEG. As a reference, this study also includes reference encoders of the respective starting points of development, as given by the first encoder release of AV1/VP9 for the AOM-driven technology, and the HM reference encoder of the HEVC standard for the JVET activities. For a large variety of video sources ranging from UHD over HD to 360° content, the compression capability of the different video coding technology has been evaluated by using a Random Access setting along with the JVET common test conditions. As an outcome of this study, it was observed that the latest AV1 release achieved average bit-rate savings of ~17% relative to VP9 at the expense of a factor of ~117 in encoder run time. On the other hand, the latest JEM release provides an average bit-rate saving of ~30% relative to HM with a factor of ~10.5 in encoder run time. When directly comparing AV1 and JEM both for static quantization parameter settings, AV1 produces an average bit-rate overhead of more than 100% relative to JEM at the same objective reconstruction quality and, in addition, with a factor of ~2.7 in encoder run time. Even when operated in a two-pass ratecontrol mode, AV1 lags behind both the JEM and HM reference encoder with average bit-rate overheads of ~55% and ~9.5%, respectively, although the latter being configured along one-pass static quantization parameter settings.},

title={" But they won't come to lectures..." The impact of audio recorded lectures on student experience and attendance},
author={Larkin, Helen E},
journal={Australasian journal of educational technology},
volume={26},
abstract={The move to increasingly flexible platforms for student learning and experience through provision of online lecture recordings is often interpreted by educators as students viewing attendance at lectures as optional. The trend toward the use of this technology is often met with resistance from some academic staff who argue that student attendance will decline. This study aimed to explore students’ use of online lectures and to measure the impact of them on student attendance at lectures. A pre and post evaluation methodology was undertaken using a self administered questionnaire that gathered both quantitative and qualitative data. Overall attendance was recorded at each lecture throughout the semester. Results indicated that attendance remained high throughout the semester and while only a minority of students used the recordings, those who did found them to be helpful. Most students used them to either supplement their learning or to make up for a lecture that they had not been able to attend. This study provides evidence that contrary to popular belief, Generation Y students in general, do not aspire to replace lectures with downloadable, online versions. Many of the students in this study valued the opportunity for interactive learning provided by face to face teaching. Finally, a model that outlines the attributes that contribute to quality teaching is used to describe how this technology can contribute to positive student experiences and can enhance reflective teaching practice. },
