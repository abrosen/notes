abstract={The routing of data in inter-vehicle communication technologies has obtained tremendous amount of researchers' attention during the last few years. Many routing protocols utilize vehicular traffic information as a metric to determine optimal routing paths to transmit data in vehicular environment. Due to the difficulty as well as the enormous deployment costs of static nodes and the arduous effort to obtain non-real-time traffic information, the existing traffic information collection mechanisms could not provide the efficiency that is needed for the VANETs environment. In this paper, we present a novel collaborative real-time traffic information collection mechanism. It includes hybrid traffic information collection, road weight information dissemination, as well as the hybrid traffic geographic routing. The collaborative real-time traffic information collection mechanism effectively collects and disseminates real-time hybrid traffic information such as node density and network traffic load. In most VANET routing protocols, the network traffic load is always ignored and this action may cause network performance degradation in heavy-traffic load networks. In proposed hybrid traffic geographical routing, a forwarding node at a junction adaptively decides on a routing path based on the real-time hybrid traffic information. It consists of successions of road junctions to find the destination node for the data packet. Between two consecutive junctions on the path, geographical forwarding is used to select forwarding nodes on the road. Simulation results not only shows the proposed mechanism has the ability to collect real-time traffic information effectively with only slight control overhead, yet also has the ability to avoid from choosing an already congested path. Simulation results also show that the proposed mechanism outperforms routing protocols like GSR (Geographic Source Routing) and GyTAR (improved Greedy Traffic Aware Routing Protocol) in terms of average del ivery ratio.},

  note={VANETS need to handle rapid topological changes, something MANETs are unable to accomplish.  VANETs need to deal with distribution of nodes, extreme mobility, and  obsticles that physically block transmission. many of these challenges apply to sattilites: satillites are highly mobile, move at extremely high speeds but within a predictable path, and have to deal with physical objects that are, dare I say it, astronomical in size, such as massive spheres of rock and giant balls of fire.  Former algorithms, such as A-star and GSR failed to take into account real time conditions, direction, or velocity, extremely pertinent factors to VANETs and the last two are extremely relevant if we using a greedy algorithms, like A-STAR and GSR did. 
  
  GyTAR consists of two components: Junction selection and forwarding data between two junctions.  First, let us elaborate on junctions.  A junction is simply where two roads happen to join or create an intersection.  If we were to convert our system of roads into a more familiar representation of vertices and edges, our junctions would be the vertices.  Anyhow, when we are sending some packet, the vehicle currently responsible for it will want to forward that packet on towards the junction that has the best combination of being closest to destination and having the highest traffic density.  The second component forwards packets once we've selected a desired junction.  Our node will now calculate the node to send the packet by looking at the list of all the neighbors, calculating their *predicted* position based on their velocity (direction and magnitude).  The neighbor calculated to be closest to the next junction receives the packets.  This is an improvement over the previous algorithms as it takes into account both the motion of the cars, the geography, and the traffic density.  Despite the fact GyTAR still fails on a local optimum, the authors touch on one of the basic principles of DTN architecture in their recovery strategy - "carry and forward."  When the node can't pass off the packets to a better-placed vehicle, it will hold  onto the data until that situation changes.  In a sense, the node has taken ?implicit? responsibility for that particular piece of data.
 
  In a DTN scenario, a vehicle would take responsibility for whole bundles, which would effectively be as many packets as a single transmission can bear.  At each hop, another vehicle would receive the whole bundle and acknowledge responsibility for the bundle, allowing the sender to free up its buffer.},

  note={The acronym VANET wasn't adopted yet.  Again notyes MANET algorithms won't cut it for a VANET.  Unicast routing should be used for 2 way communication, whereas geocast routing should be used when trying to obtain infor about particular geographical regions.  Cities present a much different challenge than a highway setting due to three different factors:  flow of traffic and congestion (multiple stops and lights vs none), traveling along a line as opposed to traveling along a plane in a city, and the fact buildings provide obstruction where some would not mornally exist.  To perform position based routing, we have to know the posiotion of all participants in the netowrk, which can be done GPS devices on the nodes, with direct neighbors being aware of each other via beaconing.
  
  A greedy approach for message delivery in position based routing is simply choose the next node closest to the sink.  This is a local, ad-hoc decision that requires no established infrastructure, but it will fail if there is no neighbor closer than self.
  
  GSR takes advantage of a map and uses flooding to pass its message forward.},

note ={Important paper. History: IVC 1980s


The primary goal of for routing techniques is minimize the amount of time and overhead costs inflicted by communication.

MANETs do not generally use infrastructure as a rule, however VANETs sometimes use cellular gateways or fixed access points along intersections.  This give us three classification of VANETs based on their archetecture: completely ad-hoc,  use the cellular towers and/or WLAN access points, or a combination of the two.  footnote(While one could assert that access points might be made available the sides of roads, this is infeasible due to the costs involved.)

While VANETS have many of the same qualities as other ad-hoc networks, they are distinguished by a number of unique factors:

The high speeds of vehicles:

Highly variable topology: Due to the aforementioned high speeds, the topology of the network, ie which nodes are connected or can connect , will not remain stable. For example, two vehicles driving \(20\frac{m}{sec}\) in opposite directions with a maximum transmission range of \(200 m\) might have as short as 10 seconds to establish a connection and exchange information.

  CFDP has two primary modes of operation.  The first is an end to end transmission over a single link.  The second, an extended operation mode, is used for scenarios where no direct link between the source and destination exist.  Reliability, when selected, is accomplish using one of four NAK modes.},

  note={Implements store-carry-forward so that there is no need for application changes.  Instead of the network layer returning an ICMP destination unreachable message, the packets are sent to a piggyback software module, which handles the store carry forward mechanics.  Tests in OMNeT++ show that the piggyback module creates higher data transfer and lower delays.}
