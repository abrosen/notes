We have successfully developed our software to achieve this, but need funding to do real world network tests. 
These tests would allow us to experimentally show that our software conclusively works on

I need hardware of different types and locations.

This project would help by enabling allowing  both organizations with large amounts of computing power and average developers with a fewer resources spend less time setting up and configuring their hardware to work together;  the goal is for our software to make distributed computing more of matter of ``plug-and-play.''
