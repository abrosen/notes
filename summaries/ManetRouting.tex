\section{Ara}
Ara \cite{ara-ants} is short for Ant-Colony-Based Routing Algorithm; this paper is an application of ant communication applied on-demand ad-hoc routing in Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks (MANETs)
Ant colony algorithms are a type of swarm intelligence where simple workers following simple rules produce complex behaviors.  

A key feature is that ants don't directly communicate with each other; ants rely on stigmergy, whereby communcation is established by modifying the environment.
